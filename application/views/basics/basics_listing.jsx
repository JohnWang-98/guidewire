        description: "Guidewires were initially invented and used by Dotter and Judkins to cross a disease segment of the artery for further intervention. However, the initial wire used for coronary intervention was a spring coil guidewire over which a series of large rigid dilators were advanced. Andreas Gruentzig replaced these dilators with inflatable balloons, which were introduced percutaneously, hence pioneering the era of percutaneous coronary angioplasty. After Gruentzig pioneered the first angioplasty, a group of cardiologists met and formed a registry under The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Since then, significant improvement in different types of equipment and techniques were made." +
            "The original dilatation catheter with a short tip of guidewire could not be modified once the catheter was introduced, providing the operator with no control to maneuver the catheter/wire inside the vessel. In 1981, Dr. Simpson developed a new catheter system with an independently steerable guidewire located in the balloon catheter’s central lumen, replacing the short fixed non-steerable wire tip (5 mm) manufactured by Andreas Grüntzig.1 The introduction of the coaxial steerable guidewire was the first revolution in the history of coronary angioplasty. Compared to the early version of guidewires, modern guidewires are designed to combine tip softness, trackability around curves, precise torque control, which allow the guidewire to be steered through tortuous vessels and side branches."

            "Core Material:  The core is usually made of stainless steel, which provides excellent support with excellent torque transmission but is less flexible and not kink resistant. On the other hand, nitinol core, a super-elastic alloy of nickel and titanium, has more flexibility, excellent resiliency, and kink resistance. Newer wires (hybrid type) are made of stainless steel and nitinol distal tip for better torque transmission and excellent flexibility with kink resistance. (I.e. Runthrough, Minamo, Maestro, Specter)." +
            "Core Diameter: It is the part of the wire that tapers to the tip, not the wire’s overall size, and determines the flexibility (smaller diameter) and support (larger diameters)." +
            "Core Taper:  This is the part of the wire that extends from the core to the tip. The ability to transmit torque depends on the taper’s length; shorter tapers tend to prolapse but provide more support, while longer tapers offer less support but track successfully." +
            "II.Tip:  It is the distal tip of the wire. Various tip designs could affect the steer ability of the wire." +
            "Core to Tip:  Core extends to the tip of the wire. This design provides precise tip control and increases the wire’s diameter, enhancing the wire’s stiffness to help cross-resistant lesions." +
            "Shaping Ribbon: Core does not reach the distal tip of the wire but is wrapped in a ribbon of flexible metal to make the tip more flexible, atraumatic, and allows shape retention." +

The distal part of the composite core wire consists of core and twist wires, whereas the proximal portion of the wire is composed of rope coil, twist, and core wires." +

            "III.Body (Coil, Cover, and Sleeve): The body of the wire surrounding the core is usually made up of coils or polymers (plastic). Coils help maintain constant diameter, torque control, and tactile feedback. Various coil forming technologies have evolved in the contemporary era. Weaving multiple small wires into a coil is the most popular one, resulting in increased strength and a better torquability and torque response than a single coil." +

            "Hybrid wire combines the hydrophobic tip for better tactile feedback with hydrophilic coating for smooth device delivery. In the contemporary era, the vast majority of guidewires have a hydrophilic coating. Put merely, hydrophilic wires increase lubricity, and hydrophobic wires increase tactile feedback." +

            "Radiopaque length: The distal tip, an opaque part under x-rays, is usually about 30mm in length except for specialized CTO wires. It helps to make a measurement of the diseased segment and recognize for easy wire location. Some specialty wires have multiple radiopaque segments, such as the Medtronic Zinger Marker and Boston Scientific Forte Support Marker for more accurate measurements."

        description: "Changes in the composition of wire components could provide distinct characteristics and properties of the wire. Hence, appropriate wire selection heavily depends on the understanding of the various wire properties. The following terminologies can describe the specifications of the guidewire." +
            "I.Torquability: It is an ability to transmit rotating elements applied on the proximal end of the wire (outside of the guiding catheter) to the tip of the wire. It is the crucial determinant of the operator’s ability to steer the wire through the vessel precisely. An ideal wire should provide a 1:1 torque, which can be affected by core composition, tip stiffness, and surface coating." +
            "II.Flexibility: Ability of the wire to flex on its longitudinal axis while maintaining its trackability and torquability. It is the critical determinant of the tip strength. Flexible wires are soft and generally atraumatic. A wire’s flexibility can be labeled extra floppy/light, floppy/soft, and stiff." +
            "III.Shape ability: The ability to modify the guidewire’s distal tip before the procedure to access difficult anatomies or perform intentional drilling through a CTO." +
            "IV.Shape Retention: A wire’s ability to retain an intended shape after being exposed to deformation and stress. Different strategies improve shape retention, including Asahi’s composite core, which uses an additional coil and wire inside." +
            "V.Nitinol wires such as Terumo’s Runthrough, as an inherent characteristic of the metal, have better shape retention than stainless steel." +
            "VI.Tactile Feedback: Any physical sensation felt through the wire’s proximal end during wire advancement inside the coronary artery. Hydrophobic coatings offer the best feedback, but such wires advance with more difficulty than slippery hydrophilic wires. An additional polymer sleeve could further reduce feedback." +
            "VII.Track ability or deliverability or crossing: It is an ability to follow the tip and advanced smoothly along the vessel through stenosis or occlusion. Track ability is improved by nitinol core material and longer taper length, hydrophilic coatings, and polymer sleeves. Asahi Sion Black and conventional guidewires are advanced trackability-focused guidewires into an artificial vessel. A comparison of guidewire surface roughness in jacketed wire vs. spring coil wire is illustrated." +
            "VIII.Tip Load: Tip load can be determined by advancing the wire into a standard surface until it deflects the tip, at 2mm from the tip. A high tip load can help when crossing a resistant or highly stenotic lesion, while a low tip load makes the tip very soft and atraumatic. Tip load is predominantly determined by core material and thickness, with stainless steel core-to-tip style used for the highest tip loads." +
            "*There are various ways to measure the tip load depending on the manufacturer. The method shown here is used by Abbott." +
            "IX.Support: It is a measure of a guidewire’s resistance to a bending force. A more supportive wire can aid in device delivery and vessel straightening, while a less one could assist in accessing through tortuous anatomy. Support and propensity for wire prolapse are directly related." +
            "X.Whip: A smooth torque input from the operator results in a sudden jerk at the wire’s distal end. This effect can be minimized through hydrophilic coatings and polymer covers/sleeves. In the chart below, the dotted line shows a whip response plotted. The y = x line demonstrates an ideal guidewire with a 1:1 torque response contrasted with the erratic whip visualized by the dotted line."

            "The majority of guidewires are straight tipped and can be modified/shaped according to the vessel contour. The tip can be shaped with either the introducer needle or the shaping needle that comes along with the wire. Usually, a simple J shaped curve at the wire’s distal end will help track the wire through the vessel. The wire should be advanced gently through the stenosis segment. Forceful pushing of the wire can result in plaque disruption, leading to acute thrombus formation and occlusion of the vessel. It is recommended that 180 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise rotations of the wire should be performed during advancement in order to avoid wire advancement into smaller branches.5 However, the wires 360-degree rotations should be avoided, particularly when a second wire is required to prevent wires’ entanglement." +
            "The wire tip should be placed as distal as possible, so the wire’s stiff part is across the lesion, providing adequate support and can track interventional devices." +

        description: "Microcatheter and over-the-wire balloons are low profile and trackable systems with end-holes. It provides good wire support and allows precise wire control by preventing flexion, kinking, and prolapse of the guidewire, especially in complex coronary intervention. It is useful in navigating tortuous or angulated lesion, CTO lesion, complex bifurcation with or without acute angle side branch, and re crossing a jailed side branch. Hence, microcatheter and guidewire are used as a single unit (e.g., Fielder + FineCross) to navigate challenging anatomy in complex coronary intervention." +
